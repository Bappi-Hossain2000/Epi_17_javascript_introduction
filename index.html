// Question no-1: Write a JavaScript program that takes a string variable called name and prints "Hello, [name]!" to the console. For example, if name = "John", the output should be "Hello, John!".
 
var name = "John!";
console.log("hello", name);

// Question no-2: Create a JavaScript program that calculates the sum of two numbers, a and b, and prints the result to the console. For example, if a = 5 and b = 10, the output should be 15.

var a = 20;
var b = 10;
var sum = a + b;
console.log(sum);

// Question no-3: Declare a variable called age and assign it your age. Then, print "I am [age] years old." to the console. For example, if age = 25, the output should be "My age is 25".
var age = 25;
console.log("I am", age, "years old");

// Question no-4: Given 3 subjects Math, English, and Physics find the total marks and average of 3 subjects.
var Math = 85;
var Physics = 80;
var English = 88;
var totalMarks = Math + Physics + English;
var averageMarks = totalMarks / 3;
console.log(averageMarks);

// Question no-5: Create 4 variables. 2 in the camel case and 2 in the snake case. (it could be anything) make sure itâ€™s meaning full and print all the values in the console

var totalMark = 100;
var averageMark = 200;
var man_women = 50;
var car_micro = 70;
console.log(totalMark, averageMark, man_women, car_micro);
